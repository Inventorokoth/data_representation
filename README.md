# data_representation
representation  of data using a graph using chart.js
this project uses a comma separated value (csv) dataset from NASA that shows the global average temperature change from the last 
couple of decades.
i specifically pick out the latitude and longitude and using chart.js i plot out the values thus displaying a line graph that
clearly shows the change in global temperature.
